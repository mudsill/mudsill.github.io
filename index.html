       <p>had an idea for a story about a guy who's going insane because there's only a curtain wall separating his bedroom from his neighbor's apartment. he thinks about killing the neighbor all the time. his fantasies are hyperviolent. one day he comes back from work and finds the guy who lives under the neighbor fucking the neighbor up bad in the hall. freebie, right? but for some reason he jumps in and punches the downstairs neighbor. the guy's so surprised that the neighbor from across the hall gets a sneak shot in on his stomach. downstair neighbor's laid out on the ground gasping for air while the neighbor from across actually thanks the guy for hitting him. then the guy calls the cops. downstairs neighbor gets taken away. the neighbor goes back into his apartment and calls a whole bunch of people for a party to celebrate. meanwhile the guy lies awake with his hand all swollen up listening to them for the whole night.</p>
      <p>this was while falling asleep, which I didn't do, because my neighbor kept me up for fucking hours.</p>
