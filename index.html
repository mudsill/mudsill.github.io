      <p>A teenager takes a job as a babysitter for a wealthy family while they're on vacation. She spends three weeks with them. Things go well: the family likes her, and she develops a close friendship with their son. Years later, the boy is the victim of a brutal murder: a friend of his cuts him to pieces while they're hanging out at his house. The girl moves to the city to attend university. She finishes studying, takes a series of jobs, falls in and out of love. One day she begins to notice small signs of a very odd occurrence: many small things catch her eye which seem to be both out of place and time. On her way home she becomes confused; the streets she's on are familiar to her, but they aren't where they should be. She realizes that she is on the way to the vacation house of the family for which she'd been a babysitter all those summers ago. Entering, she finds them all together in the living room. It's as if she's never left. She's no longer aware that anything has changed. She talks with the parents, plays with the little children, and goes out in the evening with the older boy. As they walk into the town she catches their reflection in the window of a restaurant. She is the older she. What the boy is is too horrible to describe. An impossible opportunity has fallen into her lap: do almost anything and she will alter the course of all subsequent events. She looks at him, at their reflection, at herself most of all. He asks her if something is wrong. No, she tells him. Just seeing things that aren't there. And they go on.</p>

      <p>guy is stranded on a desert island. it's beautiful, and he's completely alone. the island isn't very big and doesn't have a lot of animals on it except for a few birds that land from time to time and coconut crabs. the crabs look awful but are basically harmless. he spends his time on the beach watching them. one day, he notices that one of the crabs is holding something metallic. it turns out to be a key. the next day, the crabs show up with an arm from a pair of steel-framed glasses. the guy decides to see where the crabs are getting these things. he follows them down the beach a long way, farther than he's ever gone. the island turns out not to be small at all: they walk for several days and nights. eventually, they come to a cove. inside the cove are the remains of a fishing ship. inside that are the remains of the crew, and the crabs, who are scavenging. when the guy comes outside again, he finds someone else there waiting for him. the new guy explains that he was crew on the ship. he shows him his service tag. he says that a storm ran them aground. he says everyone died except him, the radio operator. he's been working on fixing the ship's unit and he's almost done. it's a strong signal, and he thinks there's a strong chance someone will pick it up. he says he's really grateful to find someone else, because he was so afraid being alone.</p>
      <p>now it's the first guy again. he's swimming in the ocean, towards the beach. it's his beach. as he comes ashore, he passes by a coconut crab. it has something in its claw: a service tag. the guy throws it in the sea.</p>

      <p>had an idea for a story about a guy who's going insane because there's only a curtain wall separating his bedroom from his neighbor's apartment. he thinks about killing the neighbor all the time. his fantasies are hyperviolent. one day he comes back from work and finds the guy who lives under the neighbor fucking the neighbor up bad in the hall. freebie, right? but for some reason he jumps in and punches the downstairs neighbor. the guy's so surprised that the neighbor from across the hall gets a sneak shot in on his stomach. downstair neighbor's laid out on the ground gasping for air while the neighbor from across actually thanks the guy for hitting him. then the guy calls the cops. downstairs neighbor gets taken away. the neighbor goes back into his apartment and calls a whole bunch of people for a party to celebrate. meanwhile the guy lies awake with his hand all swollen up listening to them for the whole night.</p>
      <p>this was while falling asleep, which I didn't do, because my neighbor kept me up for fucking hours.</p>
